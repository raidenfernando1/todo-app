This is a personal Todo application built with Astro (SSR) and React, powered by TypeScript, BetterAuth for authentication, and NeonDB for storage. I created it mainly for myself to manage tasks but also as a way to explore and learn Astroâ€™s server-side rendering capabilities in a real project.

The app features a rich text editor for each task, allowing more detailed notes, formatting, and organization compared to plain-text todo lists. This makes it useful not just for simple tasks, but also for keeping context, ideas, and extra details directly alongside your todos.
